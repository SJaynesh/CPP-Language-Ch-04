# Encapsulation :

<br><br>

## `Data Encapsulation`
(Encapsulation / Data Hiding)

<br>

> * `Encapsulation means wrapping code as much as you can in a class.`
> * Every logic must be written in class.
> * The meaning of Encapsulation is to make sure that **"sensitive" data is hidden from users**.
> * It helps in hiding the implementation details and provides data protection.
> * To achieve this, we **must declare class varibles/attributes** as **private**(cannot be accessed from outside the class).
> * If you want others **to read or modify the value** of a private member, you can provide **public getter and setter methods**.

<br/><br/>

## `Setter & Getter` 

<br>

 ` setter ` 
 
 <br>

  > * A method which is used to set(initialize) the data members.
  > * A function to take input of attributes.

<br/>

  ` getter `

<br>

 > * A method which is used to get(access) the data members.
 > * A function to give output of attributes.

<br/>

`NOTE : `
> Both setter & getter must be public for access and modify the data members.

<br><br>

## `this Keyword`

<br>

> * `When class attributes and function parameters both have same name, then we can make difference and identify the class attributes using this keyword`.
> * The this keyword is pointer that points to the current instance of a class.
> * It is a special keyword that is used within the member funtions of a class to refer to the object on which the function is called.
> * this keyword is written before the class attributes.

<br>

`USE : `

<br>

> * this->varName
> * this of variable name.

<br><br>

### `private attributes`

<br>

> * Access to provide attributes is controlled through public methods (getter and setters).
> * Private attributes are support only for class.

<br><br>

### `Nasted member function`

<br>

> * A nested member function is a function within a function.

<br><br>

## `Array of Objects`

<br>

> * An array of objects is a collection of object of the same class stored in contiguous memory locations.
> * Eash element of the array is an instance of the class.

<br><br>

<br><br>

## `Scope Resulation Operator`

<br>

> * The scope resoultion operator (::) is used to access elements in a class or to access global variables.
> * It allows you to specify the context in which a particular identifier (variable, function, or class) is defined.

<br>

` Commonly it is used for: `

 > Access Global Variables
 > Access Static Members

<br><br>

## `static Keyword`

<br>

> * A static is a keyword or modifier that belongs to the type not instance. So **instance is not requied to access the static members**.
> * In C++, a static can be field, method, constructor, class, or properties.
> * A field which is declared as static is called static field. It is shared among all the objects.
> * These are the members which represents the class directly.
> * These members are common for the all class objects.
> * These member also gives the same value for all class objects.
> * There are two types of static members:

<br>

### `Use case of static Keyword`

<br>

> 1. Static Data Members
> 2. Static Members Functions 

<br/><br/>

### `Static Data Members`

<br>

> * Attributes created using **static** keyword.
> * This kind of variables acquires the memory space only once among all objects.
> * static data members must be assigned once in global area using **scope resolution operator** according to following syntex.
> * `::` scope resolution operator or Membership lable operator.
> * `DataType  ClassName :: varName = value;`
> * static data members gives the same value for all class objects.

<br/><br/>


### `Static Member Functions`

<br>

> * class methods created using **static** keyword.
> * these kind of methods can only used with static atributes.
> * normal data members(attributes) aren't supported in static member functions.
> * these methods can be accessed directly only if there are public
> * static member function can be accessed like following syntex.
> * `ClassName :: methodName([arguments]);`


<br><br>

## Constructor :

<br>

> * `Constructor is a block of code which is automatically invoked when class is instanciated.`
> * Constructor is automatically called when an object(instance of class) is created. It is a special member function of the class.

<br>

### Rules to Create Constructor :

<br>

> * The name constructor must be same as class name.
> * Constructor cannot have any return datatype like void, int, char, etc...
> * Constructor cannot return anything.

<br/>

## Types of Constructor :

<br>

> `1. Default Constructor` <br><br>
> `2. Parameterised Constructor` <br><br>
> `3. Copy Constructor` <br><br>


<br/><br/>

### 1. Default Constructor :

<br>

> * `Default constructor is the constructor which doesnâ€™t take any argument. It has no parameters. In this case, as soon as the object is created the constructor is called which initializes its data members. `

<br/>

<pre>
  #include<iostream>
  using namespace std;

  class City {
  	
  	//default Constructor
  	public :
  		
  	City() {
  		cout << "My City Surat ...";
  	}
  };
  
  int main()
  {
  	City c1;	
  }
     
</pre>


<br/><br/>

### 2. Parameterised Constructor :

<br>

> * `These are the constructors with parameters. Using this Constructor you can provide different values to data members of different objects, by passing the appropriate values as arguments. `

<br/>

<pre>
 
  #include<iostream>
  using namespace std;

  class City {
  	
  	private :
  		char cityName[];
  		int pincode;
  	
  	//Parameterized Constructor
  	public :
  		
  		City(string cityName, int pincode) {
  			
  			this->cityName = cityName;
  			this->pincode = pincode;
  			
  		}
  		
  		void getData()
  		{
  			cout << "CITY NAME : " << cityName << endl;
  			cout << "PINCODE : " << pincode << endl;
  		}
  };
  
  int main()
  {
  	City c1("Surat",395010);
  	
  	c1.getData();
  		
  }
     
</pre>


<br/><br/>

### 3. Copy Constructor :

<br>

> * ` A copy constructor  is a member function which initializes an object using another object of the same class. `
> * to copy data of another object.
> * Both object must belong to the same class.
> * Two types of copy constructor.
> * `1. Implicit  `
> * `2. Explicit  `

<br/>

#### `1. Implicit  : `

<br/>

<pre>
 #include<iostream>
 using namespace std;

class City {
	
	private :
		string cityName;
		int pincode;
	
	//Copy Constructor
	public :
		
		City(string cityName,int pincode) {
			this->cityName = cityName;
			this->pincode = pincode;
		}
		
		void getData()
		{
			cout << endl << "City Name : " << cityName << endl;
			cout << "Pincode : " << pincode << endl;
		}
		
	
};

int main()
{
	City c1("Surat",395010);
	City c2 = c1; // Implicit 
	

	c1.getData();
	c2.getData();
		
}
</pre>

<br/>

#### `2. Explicit  : `

<br/>

<pre>
 #include<iostream>
 using namespace std;

class City {
	
	private :
		string cityName;
		int pincode;
	
	//Copy Constructor
	public :
		
		City(string cityName,int pincode) {
			this->cityName = cityName;
			this->pincode = pincode;
		}
		
		City(City &c) {
			this->cityName = c.cityName;
			this->pincode = c.pincode;
		}
		
		void getData()
		{
			cout << endl << "City Name : " << cityName << endl;
			cout << "Pincode : " << pincode << endl;
		}
		
	
};

int main()
{
	City c1("Surat",395010);
	City c2(c1); // Explicit 
	

	c1.getData();
	c2.getData();
		
}
</pre>

<br/><br/>

## Destructor :

<br>

> * `A Block of code which is automatically invoked when a program is completed or an object is deleted.`

<br/>

### Rules to Create Constructor :

<br>

> * It's name must be same as class name but it begies with tild '~' operator.
> * Destructor cannot have any return datatype like void, int, char, etc...
> * It cannot return anything.

<br/>

<pre>
 #include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class City {
	
	private :
		string cityName;
		int pincode;
	
	
	public :
		// Constructor
		City(string cityName,int pincode) {
			this->cityName = cityName;
			this->pincode = pincode;
		}
		
		// Destructor
		~City() {
			cout << "Code is End";
		}
		
		void getData()
		{
			cout << endl << "City Name : " << cityName << endl;
			cout << "Pincode : " << pincode << endl;
		}
		
	
};

int main()
{
	City c1("Surat",395010);
	
	c1.getData();
		
}
</pre>

## Friend Function:

<br>

> * `It is the type of function by which we can access private attributes or methods of any class.`
> * It can be created using friend keyword.

<br>

### friend Keyword:

<br>

> * friend returnDataType functionName();

<br>

> * It's being used as a getter when doesn't contain it's own getter.
> * `Though friend function can also access the private attributes of class, it can be us as a getter of one or more class.`

<br>
